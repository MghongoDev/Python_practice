## Python Projects to Enhance My Programming Skills

## 1. The funny_name_generator.py script generates random funny names based off the popular TV series "Psych".

## 2. The pig_latin.py script turns a word into its pig Latin equivalent. It's a fun play on words.

## 3. The poor_man_bar_chart.py script maps letters from a string into a dictionary and prints a bar chart of frequency of the letters.
